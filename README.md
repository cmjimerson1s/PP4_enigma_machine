## Design

### Colours
 The decision to use black, white, and yellow as the color palette for the site is to create a visually striking and immersive user experience. The combination of these colors can evoke a sense of mystery, excitement, and adventure, aligning with the theme of escape rooms.<br>
 Segments of the website are either dark, or have a shadowy filter over images. The darker color represents the intrigue and suspense associated with escape rooms, creating an atmosphere of anticipation.<br>
 Contrasting against the black background, key elements such as text, buttons, and icons are presented in a clean, crisp white color. The white color enhances readability and provides a sense of clarity, ensuring that important information and calls to action stand out prominently.<br>
 To inject energy and highlight important elements, vibrant yellow accents are strategically incorporated throughout the website. The yellow color represents excitement, challenge, and adventure, aligning with the thrill of solving puzzles and escaping from the rooms. Yellow is used sparingly but effectively to draw attention to specific areas, such as buttons, links, or important messages.<br>
 Overall, the black, white, and yellow color palette for the escape room website aims to create a visually captivating and immersive experience for users. It combines the intrigue of black, the clarity of white, and the excitement of yellow to align with the adventurous and thrilling nature of escape rooms, enticing visitors to explore the website and book their escape room experience.<br>
